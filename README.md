I made a discord server here. You can talk about stuff from this mod, give feedback, or just want a place to chill. There's also a fandom wiki page for V.O.W here. It's still a work in progress though!

Woah, 6k downloads... You guys are truly the best. Thank you!

DISCLAIMER:
This mod was intended for players who have already beaten Fire Emblem Fates on either paths. However, with all the shenanigans that's going on, I think it's fine going in blind! Currently, the only path that has content is CONQUEST, although the paralogues can still be played in any other paths. This mod is heavily story-based and some character lines (in combat, event lines, and in some paralogues) contain fully voiced AI voices.

For those who didn't look into the File Info section, this mod is intended for Special Edition. If you play it on any other editions, I am not so sure what the result will be. 

For hardware users, it is mandatory to compile this mod into a cia. For emulator users, it's recommended for smoother gameplay. From the reports given to me, this mod has probably the same hardware requirements as Xenoblade Chronicles 3DS.

What is V.O.W (Visitors [from] Other Worlds) Edition?
Even with its flaws, Fire Emblem Fates remains to be one of my most beloved games in the series. The story is considered abominable to many, so I've decided to take some of my time and make own take of the story. Well, after months of hard work, here it is! The story is still not perfect, but at least it'll make sense for the most part. 

...At least that WAS the intention of it. I thought it would be funny to add Geralt of Rivia into the mix, but now it's spiraled out of control. Like Geralt, there will be other guest characters in the play! Some familiar, some unknown to others, and some original! 

The section below will describe what has been added into the game.

Content:
- Various story changes, which includes new cutscenes and a removal of certain "game decisions." Hover over on the spoilers to see the chapters that affect gameplay. (As of v.15, most of the decisions have been restored/can be skipped. You can still see what's up though.

1. Lilith lives, but there is no decision to make her playable... Yet. (In modpack, Playable Lilith has been added, so she is playable there!)
2. An extra chapter has been added after Chapter 21 CQ.  As of v.13, the chapter can be skipped!
3. Ryoma's "waiting" is shorter in Chapter 25 CQ. Player gets to choose whether to fight or let someone else do the fighting for them...

-Twenty-five new characters with classes exclusive to them (with the exception of one). One character is unavailable for the entire Conquest route until the last chapters for story reasons.
- Twelve new Paralogues. Those marked with the (STORY) tag on their name are preset units. If you lose them during the chapter, they will still be recruited as long as you win.
Jessie's Paralogue: "The Wild Stand Off" (Chapter 7 on any path). Special interaction if Anna is alive in your army. Jessie will permanently join your army after completing the chapter.
Botan's Paralogue: "The Forgotten Sword Saint" (Chapter 16 CQ unlock/ Chapter 13 BR unlock). Botan will join your party upon completion. HAS LATE GAME DIFFICULTY!!!
Geralt's Paralogue: "The White Wolf" (Chapter 7 on any path). Use preset units to complete paralogue and he will join.
Kenobi's Paralogue: "A Visitor from the Stars" (Unlocks after completing Paralogue Geralt). Use preset units to complete the chapter and they will join.
Shulk's Paralogue: "The Hero of Colony 9" (Unlocks after completing Kenobi's Paralogue). Shulk will permanently join your army after completing the chapter.
Beatrice's Paralogue: "The Vanished Queen" (Unlocks when two conditions have been met: 1. Azura and Jessie are alive, 2. Chapter 15 of any path). You'll get Beatrice and Iroryu in your army when you beat the chapter!
Kotone's Paralogue: "Out of Darkness" (Unlocks when you've completed Shulk's Paralogue and Chapter 12 from any path). Survive for 10 turns and you'll permanently get Vergil, Tara, and Kotone in your army!
Zack's Paralogue: "A Fleeting Memory" (Unlocks if you've completed Beatrice's paralogue). Use the preset units to defeat the boss and you'll permanently get Zack, Aerith, Zoro, and Xion in your army! WARNING: DIFFICULTY MAY VARY DEPENDING ON YOUR LUCK!
Johnny's Paralogue: "Red Petals, Silver Hand" (Unlocks if you completed Chapter 10 of any path, and Shulk is alive). You'll permanently get Ruby Rose, Johnny, and Asagi if you beat the chapter with the premade units!
Tanya's Paralogue: "Cry of the Condemned" (Unlocks if you completed Johnny's Paralogue, completed Chapter 11 in any path, and Shulk is alive). You'll permanently get Sol Badguy, Tanya, and Labrys if you beat the chapter with them alive!
Melia's Paralogue: "Unexpected Company" (Unlocks if you've completed Paralogues Shulk, Kenobi, Beatrice, and Zack as well as Chapter 16 in any path. Use them to defeat the mysterious army and their leaders! (WARNING: DO NOT ADD any bath towel accessories to Chad! He's going to have a very disturbing look.)
Zack & Aerith's Paralogue: "A Night To Remember" (Unlocks if you S-rank Zack and Aerith, and completed Paralogue Kenobi, Paralogue Shulk, and Paralogue Tanya)
- Three new classes for Corrin, two of which are gender exclusive. Commoner (F!Corrin), Sword Knight (M!Corrin) and Thief
- The first chapter of the Secret Path is available! It gives you all a demo of what shenanigans has yet to come! Only Conquest has the option to go to it. The unlock requirements: every guest and custom characters (except Botan, Gonar, Cathy, and Jessie) MUST be alive for the option to come up as an option after Chapter 28.
- When Kotone manages to A-rank three companions, a familiar face will be VERY interested to test out your strength! A fair warning: THIS FIGHT IS (or maybe depending on RNG) EXTREMELY DIFFICULT and you must use ANY resource to win! Spoilers: The fight with Elizabeth is VERY CLOSE to her rotations in Persona 3 Reload. If you have beaten her and know what she does, then this will feel very familiar!
- AMIIBO character battles are available after Chapter 7. There is no story implementation (yet) and there if you want to get them ASAP.
- Marth has a Glock. Enuf said. You can only get it right as you complete his AMIIBO battle. Make sure to not complete the map before installing the mod.

New Shops
- Prinny's Oddities (requires Jessie, Shulk, and Asagi to be alive initially): allows the player to negate/reduce the negative effects of certain items and even completely upgrade certain ones (etc. Kodachi to Iron Katti) for a price, buy items from their opposing path (Birthright -> Conquest, Conquest -> Birthright), and for Corrin to change the form of their Yato after a certain chapter in their path. The current forms are Lance, Axe, Bow, and Dagger, and it can be reverted back to Sword any time with no cost. Revelations will have a special item selection.

- Velvet Room: if Kotone has two A-rank supports, it will be unlocked. You will be able to purchase the personas of the respective supports!

My Post Notes:
If you read the DISCLAIMER above, there isn't really much content for the Birthright or Revelation paths. Birthright is guaranteed to have a retelling as well, however I cannot say the same for Revelations. If enough people request for it, then I'll probably consider doing it if I have more time. Eventually, your journey won't end there: a post-endgame campaign is in the works! You'll meet various foes, some you might not expect...

Anyway, I really do hope you enjoy my interpretation of FIRE EMBLEM FATES: CONQUEST for now! Thank you to everyone in the Contributors and Special Thanks section for helping me make this possible! Please check in on "File Info" before installing.

MODPACK
- Modpack is VOW with mods added on top of it. The following mods are within said pack: Yiannis' Texture Pack, Tru's Accessories, Unofficial Gay Fates, Voice Select, and Playable Lilith. Just download main V.O.W, then drop the files from modpack to it and overwrite!

A key thing to note however: you will still need to download some mods for their bu/bx folders ONLY. The following are said mods you need: Yiannis' Texture Pack, Tru's Accessories, Corrin's Wardrobe Update, and Playable Lilith. It's a way to support the original creators while supporting mine as well!

My recommended order for overwrites from first to last: Playable Lilith -> Corrin's Wardrobe -> Tru's Accessories -> Yiannis' Texture Pack

IMPORTANT: Modpack will not be updated until Secret Path has been completed. You've been warned!

SPECIAL SECTION FOR MENTIONS OF CREDIT:
https://pastebin.com/NzhFszLY

Credit list is getting too long. It will be updated within the pastebin!

KNOWN ISSUES:
- Kotone/Labrys/Elizabeth will turn into a hooded dude when animations are turned off
- Skirmishes on Custom Paralogue maps won't show and take your gold
- The one who triggers combat and the second phase with Pixie of Elizabeth's boss fight will become unselectable momentarily
- Cathy when taking damage from a Faceless will crash on modpack hardware
